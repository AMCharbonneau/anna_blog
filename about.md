I am currently on a year long adventure around the world. I have a PhD in clinical psychology. In 2014, I left my regular job as a health psychologist to travel full time. This is about travel adventure, exploring new cultures, psychology, and my new task of learning web development.

I created this blog using Jekyll by modifying the base Jekyll theme. The basic Jekyll usage documentation can be found at at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
